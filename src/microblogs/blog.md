The start of something new... that i DEFFO didnt steal from someone else..  
anyways, this is the idea that kibbles never really was.  
I just want something that lacks production value, like what I want to achieve with my blogs.  
and well a text file without formatting is as informal as you can get.  
that was the plan anyways,,, oof. had to make it an html file with damn br's everywhere for it to work  

ANYWAYS. IN SPIRIT.  
shit this took so long to plan out that i forgot what i was saying.  
well, this will probably rotate every six months or something, we'll see how long the page loads get by then or smth  

AH AH I REMEMBERED. poems. i try to write poems. and god yes theyre sappy and about my pretty pretty girlfriend (who i usually refer to as my dog/nsx)
